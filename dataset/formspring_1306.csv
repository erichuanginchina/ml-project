1785,0,0.0,Q: The children living next door are being horribly abused by their parents. The only way to stop the abuse is to adopt the children and care for them in your home. Would you?<br>A: thats really a hard question. and to be honest i dont think i could care for the amount of children that are being abused and self sacrifice my entire life for them. thats really harsh and makes me sound awful but that exact senario is happening next to my parents house and when i was about 18 i thought that is something i would have been willing to do but now i see them and how far they are that it would almost be mear unfair and unsuccessful on my part for them. its all they know. and if the state wont do anything its sad to say but what could i do by ripping them from the only home they do know and tell them its all wrong. i guess im not that selfless. and its like 12 kids. so that would be a lot. idk. but rightnow  i dont think so. just because im not in any way capable of taking care of them any better rightnow anyways. other than the not abusing them but whats worse?

Ohh no. Its out of our control.r &amp;&amp; I guess the inhumane way of growing all our food supplies is something to overlook as well. Only being that the animals literally cant think  move  do anything ut produce giagantic chicken breasts and stand in their own poop their entire life till the stock yards. Sooo its way out of our hands for that as well. r All these things need to be asked to our 'Oh SO lets make a change' president because the way I see it  theres no changes only what the government cares about is what is necessary. and that is wrong.

He's gotta make up for something else if he feels the need to take advantage of a being thats smaller and weaker that themselves or thier own. r r Hence don't think im not a feminist like all other strong figured  well headed  a female can do anything a man can do  but lets face reality and we can't. So when it comes down to it  theres nooo reason a male should ever hit another female. Ever.

7750,0,0.0,Q: Are you at all sarcastic?<br>A: I am VERY sarcastic! I suppose it depends on who I am talking to  because it bounces off more with different people. But generally  yeah DEFINITELY! Are you? :)

As long as they were happy  I would be happy :)
7777,0,0.0,Q: At what point are we good enough? When are we self-improved enough to accept ourselves?<br>A: We are always good enough.

7778,0,0.0,Q: attempt to define normal?<br>A: I don't think they is really such thing as normal.

Yeah  we have all been there  it happens to the best of us. With straight people  its not healthy to get hung up on them  so I can see why you want to get it out of your system.

Its from Urban Outfitters  and its a little gold envelope  that has a letter inside saying &quot;Cest La Vie&quot; meaning &quot;This is life&quot; or &quot;That's life&quot; in French :)
7858,0,0.0,Q: describe... your first intimate experience (:-P haha sorry  i guess i lied before) ;-) <333<br>A: HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!! No comment... :P
7859,0,0.0,Q: describe... your garden?<br>A: Hmmm  my Garden. Well it has 2 sections to it.  It starts off with a pond and a patio area  then the first section is long and narrow (ish) and goes all the way to a square shapped holey trellace thing. Its all covered in grass  but then around the edges are flower beds and trees. If you go to the end of the garden and turn left  there is more kind of around the corner  behind our garage. Then it goes onto a raised patio platform thing with a swing chair thing and it goes a little more along the back (length ways). That doesn't make ANY SENSE! Here :) lol http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=11088742&amp;id=750810466 It goes on a bit longer  and goes around the corner a little at the top and bottom. Its an odd shape  so its hard to explain :P
7860,0,0.0,Q: describe... your house???<br>A: My house? Well  my family own 5  but I assume the one that I live in now? Its a detached bungalow with a loft conversion. Its rather cool actually  in the front left and right corners  we have turrets (in my bedroom and the dining room) which make it look slightly like a castle :D My drum kit is in one of the turrets  and I think it fits nicely :)  Then we have a wooden balcony thing overlooking the garden. The Garden is made up of 2 sections really. Its a long stretch of land thing  then at the end  you turn left and it goes back and along slightly  hard to explain really lol.

7888,0,0.0,Q: Do you beleive you can be with someone  say nothing and walk away feeling like you have had the best conversation in your life?<br>A: I don't think i have ever had that if im honest. I have had it  where you have had a conversation or moment with someone  and then everytime you meet  speak to or see them again  you expect that same 'connection' thing to happen  and when it doesn't  you are utterly disappointed :(
7889,0,0.0,Q: do you believe i magic?<br>A: I don't really no. I don't think things can be moved or changed due to someones will. If you mean magic in the sense of chemistry between 2 people  then hell yessssss :P

7891,0,0.0,Q: Do you believe in God?<br>A: Umm  I don't know what I believe really. I think there is more to life than this though. Than living  dying  the end. I just don't know what.
7892,0,0.0,Q: Do you believe in Karma and Destiny?<br>A: I would like to believe in those things  it is a really nice thought. However  there are some people who seem to get the good things happen to them constantly  no matter of how they treat others. So  No :(
7893,0,0.0,Q: Do you believe in life after death? If so  what kind? i.e. reincarnation  Heaven/Hell  something else?<br>A: I suppose this is kind of the same as my last
7894,0,0.0,Q: Do you believe in the afterlife? Reincarnation?<br>A: I do actually. Well I believe that this life cannot be the end. I think there is something after our lives  but I wouldn't know what. How about you? Any beliefs?
7895,0,0.0,Q: Do you believe that everything happens for a reason?<br>A: I wish it did  and I think that things can happen to people that make them a better person  but only because they choose to learn from their mistakes. So  I think it can happen for a reason  its all about making the most of the things that do happen :)
7896,0,0.0,Q: Do you believe that what comes around goes around?<br>A: I would like to think that yes  but unfortunately I don't think it works that way :(
7897,0,0.0,Q: Do you consider yourself a happy person?<br>A: I was  but I kind of go back and fourth. It depends on what is happening in my life at that point. I would say yes  but things can affect me really easily. Usually with other people  perhaps doing or saying something rather upsetting :(

7901,0,0.0,Q: do you eventually want to get married?<br>A: Oh god yes! I know lots of people today  are totally skipping marriage  and I don't really think that it changes much in someones relationship. However  marriage is about loyalty to each other  and I love that :) I wouldn't want a marriage to change my life from how it was before though (if that makes sense?)  I don't think a certificate saying that you both are legally now joined should change the way you treat each other. Getting married can also take a spark out of a relationship  and thats sad :(
7902,0,0.0,Q: do you ever actually read my responses to your questions? just curious...<br>A: I do indeed! :D I check for answers of any question that I post  no point in asking them otherwise is there? :P

7909,0,0.0,Q: do you get along with you age group well? or are you better with younger or older people?<br>A: I think I do get along with most people pretty easily. I think older people  are probably the least I get on with (older as in 10 years ish) because I clash a little with my views  opinions etc. I definitely get along with my own age group  and younger people the same  if not better :) Sorry  that was a boring answer :/
7910,0,0.0,Q: Do you get drunk quickly?<br>A: I actually don't :( I tend to have to drink WAY more than my friends before I feel the affects of alcohol :( I think my tally once was about 15 vodka/cokes and I still wasn't that drunk. Only tipsy :( I eventually gave up lol!
7911,0,0.0,Q: Do you give out second chances too easily?<br>A: FARRRR TOO EASILYYYYY! :( I sometimes feel a bit walked over because of it too. My theory is  if you love someone that much  you would rather forgive than forget them :(

Unluckily  my name rhymes with a few not so nice things  so I went through all the smelly  welly  telly  belly jokes at school lol. There is one name that my mum calls me  for some random reason  called 'Fred'. I have NO idea why  may name is not Winifred  but still she continues to call me it. Its suck now  but I think its a mum thing and anyone else using it would be weird :/
7915,0,0.0,Q: Do you have a particular age that you want to be married? Do you have an age limit on marriage/starting a family (like &quot;i have to at least be over the age of &#039;blah  blah  blah&#039;&quot;) and why?<br>A: Well  I don't have a plan as such  because I think it varies with each person. I mean  if the person I was dating was shaky say  then I would be more reluctant to start a family with them  but it could change later in like  and I actually get married to them. I would like to have kids by the time I am 40 though lol! Married by mid 30's? the latest?  Im not big on dates or anything  it just depends on when the right person comes along :)

7920,0,0.0,Q: do you have glasses?<br>A: I don't wear glasses  but I do have a couple of pairs of glasses with just plastic in the lenses :P They look cool  but one  Geek glasses! HELLLO! <<< COOLESS! XD
7921,0,0.0,Q: do you have your wedding all planned out? what did you want your wedding to be like as a child? do you want it that way? did you ever think about it? do you still think about it?<br>A: I never actually did the whole wedding planning thing. I haven't thought much about what I want my wedding to be like either. I want it to be more about the person  rather than all the material things that I don't deem as a priority :)

7998,0,0.0,Q: Do you trust easily?<br>A: I think I trust FAR too easily! It means I tend to get hurt more than people who don't let people in. What does it gain you in the end though? Nothing :(

I think I actually wear dresses more than any other item of clothing. Besides leggings that is  but they usually come together :)
8002,0,0.0,Q: Do you wear pajamas to places other than at your house?<br>A: I think I have worn them when I have driven somewhere to pick someone up. But I never got out of the car  and I think it was only once. Thats not too bad right? :)

8004,0,0.0,Q: do your scars remind you that the past is real?<br>A: Yes. But in an odd sense  they also remind you that you are so fragile and anything can be a turning point in your life  and I don't just mean physically :)
8005,0,0.0,Q: does height matter?<br>A: No  of course not :) Do you mean with myself or in a partner or friend? If im talking partners  then I actually prefer someone who is a shorter than me.

The car that I really wanted  (before I settled with mine) was a 5 dr Toyota Rav 4 :P In light metallic blue with grey bumpers! Made me laugh that we wanted the same one lol!  So anyway  my dream car  do you mean affordable or in a dream world? I will say both :) If money wasn't an option  I would probably choose something like a porshe Carrera GT Cabriolet  only because <333333333 But in the real world  I am happy to say I own my dream car :D A New Beetle Cabriolet. I have it in light metallic blue and have blue and white flowers/birds down the side. If I could change the colour  I would. I LOVEEEEEEE the dark metallic navy one  with the cream leather. I would actually jizz if I ever bought one like that! LOL! It costed me just over u00a37 000 and that was a lot of money for me having just turned 19  but I saved up and managed to get it :) The insurance is a bitch though  but luckily its fairly economical to run :) I also really wanted to own a Jeep Wrangler Golden Eagle in Black  but they came out last year I think  and its far too much money for me to spend on a car. Besides  they devalue really easily  and rust quite badly :(
8014,0,0.0,Q: Drugs; good  bad  ugly? Opinions generally please.<br>A: Well if you mean the legal kind  then gooood! Because they are there to help you  if you mean the illegal kind  not good  although I can see why people give into them unfortunately :(

All the floors in my house (apart from the upstairs  but I never really go up there anyway) are wooden or tiled  so its not the nicest and most comfortable place to fall asleep :S I don't think I have done it while drunk either. If im drunk  and I eventually go to bed  I actually have real problems getting to sleep (not that I don't anyway lol).

8043,0,0.0,Q: Ever wanted to become a tattooist?<br>A: I would like to be a tattoo designer  thats cool  but never the tattooist. I couldn't handle peoples blood on me (even if its through gloves) lol.

I think everyone should fight for the right person  but it depends on how that effects that other person too.

It's all about giving them a chance :)

They we wouldn't be crazy and everyone stays sane. Poor and dumb  but at least we are sane and have each other ;) ha!
8089,0,0.0,Q: gold or blue?<br>A: Well  in a jewellery sense  Gold? lol
8090,0,0.3333333333333333,Q: gold or silver?<br>A: Hmmm  how about both? Together :D

8096,0,0.0,Q: Haha  yes  no idea how that happened. But yes  it&#039;s not impossible that u may hav come across some of my stuff. I&#039;m a major-angst writer. I wrote Emily on top of a roof before Skins even thought of it. :-P  Ooh Film  interesting?! Excited?!!!<br>A: haha! Im more of a fluff lover :P But angst can be a massive importance in all that fluff creation! LOL! Actually nahhh  angst is good too. I like Fics where (Naomily wise) They get together in the story rather than being in a relationship. I think most relationships are best in the discovery period  if that makes sense? :) Film? Ohhh yeah Im excited! ITs gonna be scary  but im sure I will get used to it :D
8097,0,0.0,Q: haha aloha!well im starting from the beginning so ill let you know when i get farther.umm the first season was really good tho and quite funny but the second season is a bit more dramatic.think i liked the first season more..how was your day? :-D<br>A: Im guessing thats &quot;aloha&quot; hello  and not the goodbye. In which case I will continue... So its a bit like Skins then? Getting to know the characters  then into the second season  create a whole load of angst :) My day  well started off nicely lol. Did some odd random creative things today  but had an argument with my dad which put me in a really bad mood lol. Im okay now :) You guys have sparked me out of it  sooooo  THANK YOU :D How have you been? :)
8098,0,0.0,Q: haha do you live near a park? we could walk to the park... im at my dad&#039;s house.. so we could walk to the beach? which do you prefer  park or beach? in general?<br>A: Ummmmm  I can't even think where I do live at the moment :S Ummmmmmmmmm  oh I remember! I do live sort of near a park  but its REALLY scary at night. Best avoid. I have an idea  I have a giant trampoline outside in my garden. How about I pull out the heat lamp thing from the garage  but it over the trampoline  and we can sit on there and chat looking up at the sky? Orrrrr beach works nicely too :D I think I prefer the beach  but I don't love them in the day. I like nice walks along the beach during sunset <33333 thats lush! But Im not a big fan of sunbathing  its just boring :S lol!
8099,0,0.0,Q: haha how could i possibly make you have a really good laugh  when i cant remember that last really good laugh i had either? :-P this is just sad :-(<br>A: :( Well we shall both keep an eye out  if anything makes either of us laugh  post it on here  cool? :D Hug? :)

The End. Sad times. I hope they are doing well in life ;)
8101,0,0.0,Q: haha i like comfortable clothes... i love/need high-heels.but i dont own many... :-( i need the height  haha   and the heels dont seem to bother me..i like earthy tones  but i dont own many..or any..i like jeans.. anything  so what are your ideas for me?<br>A: Hmmmm  well lets think... For day wear  how about something like this: http://www.polyvore.com/now_feel_overwhelmed_you/set?id=17126145 It has earthy tones  but its well balanced plus its very casual quite comfortable. It you still wanted to stay very girly  and for a warm summer evening BBQ lets say something like this: http://www.polyvore.com/running_away_from_you/set?id=16955552 OR this: http://www.polyvore.com/sweet_memories/set?id=16463192 For an evening look  perhaps dinner out or an evening at the pub maybe a punked up and spicier look: http://www.polyvore.com/baby_you_rock/set?id=16444872 Perhaps going out to a club scene or something a bit more dressed up  a black ensemble? http://www.polyvore.com/bez_naslova/set?id=15743111 and because I know you like Jeans  how about a comfortable warmer option? :) http://www.polyvore.com/love_this_jeans/set?id=15496984 What do you think of the sorts of things so far? Quiet varied  but it can express personality or mooooood :) <3333

European accents huh? Wellllll  any in particular? :P lol. You can be my manequin then! What kind of things do you like? Or inspire to like? Colours? Styles? fits? Dressers? skirts? Jeans? Leggings? Just so I can start planning ;) <3333
8105,0,0.0,Q: haha im not as funny as i think i am.. :-P<br>A: I think you're funny :) No one elses opinions matter  only yoursssss :D
8106,0,0.0,Q: haha im sorry about your formspring/twitter addiction... totally my fault :-P mwahaha im diabolical that way ;-) haha p.d.>i dont like clowns either.. i like acrobats and elephants.. :-D<br>A: HAHA!

Im glad  they deserve to be freeeeeeeee...
8107,0,0.0,Q: haha im such a klutz... ;-)<br>A: Are you actually accident prone? Or just in the dream? :P
8108,0,0.0,Q: haha spoonerism (or marrowsky) is the reversal of letters in words... its a speech impediment.. like saying &#039;a blushing crow&#039; instead of a &#039;crushing blow&#039;... its rather annoying. i have it..like barely but it still happens.. its kind of funny sometime :-P<br>A: Ohhhhhh! Got it! I do that at times  only when I don't concentrate or something. I think its actually funny! I wouldn't call it an inpediment but thats just me (probably because I do it) anywayyyy....I think its funny. Its cute you do it and can at least laugh at yourself :)
8109,0,0.0,Q: haha sure you can... just let me think of some new questions...hmmm<br>A: You disappeared last night missy!!! :P I was DMing you  tweeting you and formspringing you  and you disappeared :( Anywayyyyy  You're in your SAT's right now  hopefully writing away :D
8110,0,0.0,Q: haha thanks and i LOVEDDDDDDDDDD reading your life story. it was truly fascinating.. and you sound like quite the student :-) and im happy to be considered a friend  gotta love making friends right?haha any plans for the future? something u rly wnt to do?<br>A: You loved reading it? Pshhh  was boring :P lol I think both of ours were a bit depressing  but thats the things that stick out most in life  so automatically we remember the sad things over the happier things. Its how our minds work :) Hmmm  future plans. Well apart from wanting a family  and to be happily in love with a successful home and car etc etc As for career plans  my ultimate goal would be to direct independent horror films :) I love how some of them can contain so much art (visually) as they can video. When I say independent  I mean things like &quot;The Descent&quot;  &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;  &quot;28 Days Later&quot; etc etc. Im not so much into big budget epic Hollywood movies  because it takes the essence out of capturing a moving image on film. They rely too much on special effects nowadays  and I prefer the retro approach to film making :)
8111,0,0.0,Q: haha well in MOST fanfics Emily turns out to have quite the &#039;dirty&#039; mind.. ;-) haha... then again idk how much fanfic you read?.. and if its smutty fanfic...? and yea.. i feel like i act way more &#039;dirty minded&#039; online than i am in real life--WAY MORE ;-)<br>A: Oh I can relate to that! In person  I think you need more confidence lol. I used to read LOADS of fanfic  and I will admit  I do like to read a nice balance of fluff and smut :P God! Who came up with these words?! haha  epic :) Im sure we could work out a balance in real life ;)
8112,0,0.0,Q: haha yea... we just finished learning about Edgar Allan Poe a week or 2 ago... now that is some twisted shit  he wrote a story on how a man tortued this cat.. in great detail.. and how a guy killed this guy b/c of his eye.. disturbing :-(<br>A: WTF? Really? That is some disturbing stufffffff! What do they teach you! I think you should come here and study at an English college. Just saying ;)
8113,0,0.0,Q: haha yes  sorry. i wish i was familiar with the place. and is it so good that you want to stay there? didnt mean to sound creepy there!<br>A: haha  no it wasn't creepy  I just didn't understand the question. Well  I do like Bristol  and it is DEFINITELY a good place to go out in  but I will be leaving in about 7 months to go to film school in Brighton (about 4 hours dive away each way).  Its only a year  but when I come back  depending on how film school goes  I may move  completely depending on how my career goes and what opportunities open up for me :) Thanks for asking :)
8114,0,0.0,Q: haha yes  yes you should be holding me to that ;-) haha.. do you think you have a &#039;dirty&#039; mind? (this was actually a question i wrote down  this morning  to ask you.. this just seems like the perfect time to ask) ;-) haha<br>A: HA! Oh dear God...Well...I think  if someone doesn't know me very well  then I can come across as very innocent  but once you know me  perhaps not ;) Well  lets just say  I am very similar to Emily when it comes to being 'innocent' and if I said  that Emily isn't really innocent at all  does that answer your question ;) lol How about you then? (perfect time to return the question) :P
8115,0,0.0,Q: haha you&#039;re keeping me from going insane.. so i think its healthy..... so.. you wanted to kiss me? *blushing* why didnt you..? ;-) haha<br>A: Hahahaha! Because I wasn't sure how you would react????????? How would you have reacted? :P
8116,0,0.0,Q: haha you&#039;re pretty awesome<br>A: THANKS :D But for some reason  it won't let me ask any more? :( Probably not so awesome now :'( I will keep trying :)
8117,0,0.0,Q: haha you&#039;re pretty funny do people tell you that often?<br>A: I am? Well thanks :) I don't get told that often  but my humour  its usually stupid humour  so if you find that funny  then cool :)
8118,0,0.0,Q: haha! now THAT was a SPECTACULAR answer.. :-D (about me making you feel all warm and fuzzy by being so sweet) and i have heard &#039;the writer&#039; and i LOVE it.. actually the first time i heard it was like last night.. haha my friend sent me a vid on youtube:-)<br>A: Thanks <33333 It makes me cry :'(  Also 'Speechless' by Lady Gaga!

8122,0,0.0,Q: hahaha LOL will have it in mind. Is it true you british youth drink it straight from the bottle? On this side of the pond we mix it with some juice (sometimes)<br>A: Well  it depends on where Im going.  If Im going out  then I tend to drink (probably a little too much) straight  to get me &quot;in the mood&quot; then I dont need to drink so much when Im out. Otherwise  if im at home or something  I usually mix i with something and make a cocktail :) Basically  depends on how drunk you want to get lol! Normally yes (to answer your question in a short sentence) but it may just be personally :)
8123,0,0.0,Q: hahaha... i want (currently) the blue RAV4!!!!!! haha well originally i wanted it in red  but my dad said that if he is getting me a car..he wont get me a red car..so metallic blue came second! :-P freaky<br>A: Haha!

8129,0,0.0,Q: have a nice sleep last night? and are you having a good day?<br>A: I am if im honest :) I have decided to be really productive and im making another 'Warning Contains Ideas' bag (aka Naomi's bag from Season 3) and Im in a good mood generally :) I didn't sleep well though :( I got woken up 3 times  due to stupid door bells at horrible times in the morning. Butttttt  im good anyway :) How are you doing?
8130,0,0.0,Q: have any collections?<br>A: Collections? Do you mean  do I collect stuff? Well  its funny you ask that  because I used to be a collect-a-holic! Literally anything and everything! I was a hoarder! lol I have grown out of it a bit now  but I still have a lot of the stuff upstairs. You remember the TVs show Buffy and Angel? Well I LOVED them  and I spent about u00a36 000 or something ridiculous collecting all the merchandise they made. Literally EVERYTHING they would release  I would buy with any pocket money or birthday money I would get. I loved collecting all that  but it took up so much space that it went into the loft :( As for other things  Art Sticks (otherwise known as decorated drum sticks)  guitars  shoes (to an extent)  oh everything! lol! Anything someone could collect  I collected it. :/
8131,0,0.0,Q: Have any nick names? If so  what?<br>A: During School  yes :/ Smelly Kelly  Kelly Welly  kell bell  kelly telly  fred... All from my friends too! Keepers huh? :P lol

Okayyy  lets think... Nothing that is insulting please (and yes I have had insulting things as a name  only because they rhyme  I promise  im not actually 'smelly' lol) So Smelly Kelly  Jelly Kelly  Kelly Belly  Kelly Telly (which is just odd) and no Kell Bell. So other than that  you have free reign :D I get called 'fred' by my mum all the time  I have no idea why  its just been my name for AGESSSSSS. So  up to you :D ANYTHING YOU LIKE!!!! Bar the above ;) I know why you can't think of anything  its because im too damn special to describe in one word ;) haha! joke ;P
8133,0,0.0,Q: have you always had trouble sleeping?<br>A: Pretty much  but it has got worse in the past year or so. I think  I do too much at night lol. I used to try and do all my college work at night which meant I ended up staying up really late  concentrating and went to bed with an energetic mind. Also  my job  because I get home VERY late in comparison to normal jobs   and the work that I do  involves your mind to be VERY active and stuff (ie remembering loads of things to do in your head) I come home  and Im still not able to go to bed until my head has calmed down a bit. So yeah  now its just got worse and worse and worse  but Im dealing :) I think I should just move into your time zone. Just saying :P
8134,0,0.0,Q: Have you ever been arrested?<br>A: Well no  but I had an incident at an Airport where I was taken into a security office and questioned for taking photographs of the outside. They thought I could have been a teenage  white  beret wearing terrorist :P lol

8136,0,0.0,Q: Have you ever been skiing or snowboarding? In real snow or an indoor ski slope?<br>A: no  but I really really want to snow board. Just because its so different and there is nothing else like it out there. I want to learn so badly  but in proper snow  not ski slopes  has to be the proper stuff :)
8137,0,0.0,Q: Have you ever been to a martial arts lesson? E.g. Karate  Tae-kwondo  etc?<br>A: No  but I went through a phase of ALWAYS wanting to do it (probably stemmed from watching too much Buffy :P)
8138,0,0.0,Q: Have you ever been to a stripclub? If you did  what was it like? ;-)<br>A: I actually have lol! I was on a college trip to prague  and one night when we went out  the guys wanted to go to this strip club thing. It was pretty funny  because if you were female  it was free to get in  but the boys had to pay.  The night was rather lame  because it was about our 3rd night out in a row  and 4 days without sleep  I was sat on a couch just watching people  not knowing where to look lol! I was only 16  so it was damn illegal to be there  but thats prague for you :P Then I was looking for someone  and I ended up falling down the stairs LOL! Good times...
8139,0,0.0,Q: have you ever done drugs?<br>A: I think everyone at some point has taken some form of drug  but you mean the illegal kind yeah? Well  yes. Some good  some...not so good :(
8140,0,0.0,Q: have you ever fallen in love? do you believe in love? if so do you believe in love at first sight? <3 oh and happy valentines day btw!!<br>A: HAPPY VALENTINES DAY TOO! (Even though I dont really agree with it :P) Personally  I dont think that there can be love at first sight. I think there can be what is described as a very strong connection  but I dont think it is instantly love. I could never love someone without knowing their personality first  so  for me. I have no belief  but I think you can determine whether you could love them from a first meeting :)
8141,0,0.0,Q: have you ever fancied a friend?<br>A: Yes unfortunately :( Ever read my fanfic 'Time for Coffee?' That was a BAD 'fall for' :(
8142,0,0.0,Q: have you ever farted on a bus? and blamed somebody else?<br>A: HAHAHA! No I haven't. I don't take busses very often  besides I have a car now  which I don't fart in either lol.

8157,0,0.0,Q: have you stopped answering questions?<br>A: I went to do other things :) aka tweet you all back ;)
8158,0,0.0,Q: Have your parents ever disapproved of any of your relationships?<br>A: Well  I have never really been in a serious relationship. Call it weird  but I never have. I pretty insecure about myself  so I don't have the confidence to approach or start talking to someone.  My parents don't approve about my sexuality though  so I never share anything with them about being in a relationship :)

Im having trouble dealing with something and  you know what that is  but its REALLY dragging me down. I don't know how to deal with it  and its actually driving me beyond insane :( Looking forward to next week  because its hopefully when I can do some stuff for me :)

8173,0,0.0,Q: High bed  low bed? Small bed  large bed? Soft bed  hard bed? im reusing your randomness :-)<br>A: Lowish bed  large bed  soft bed :) I prefer lower beds  only because it gives you more wall space that the bed is resting against. Which leaves more room to be creative and flow with personality :D
8174,0,0.0,Q: high beds or low beds?<br>A: Low beds :) Im not a fan of big high ones  although they look more comfortable. Im a very modern person  and I like the ones that are lower  not on the floor  but ones that enable more wall space :)

8189,0,0.0,Q: How big is your bed?<br>A: Well its a double bed  and its quite a low one. Its about 1ft off the ground :) Its black and has leather sections. I <3 it! Everyone has said that my bed is comfy! Not that everyone has slept in it O_O I just mean friends :P lol
8190,0,0.0,Q: How can the weather be hot as hell one day and cold as hell another?<br>A: CLIMATE CHANGEEEE...ahem...I have no idea. Please  I would like to know the answer to that. Yesterday it was sunny (ish)  still cold  but the sun was out  today  PISS DOWN WITH RAINNNN! Odd...
8191,0,0.0,Q: how can you think you&#039;re not hot... and you call me delusional??<br>A: Haha! Maybe we're both delusional :P Works out nicely then :)
8192,0,0.0,Q: How come you press harder on a remote control when you know the battery is dead?<br>A: Because you don't know the battery is dead UNTIL you press harder :)
8193,0,0.0,Q: how comes you don&#039;t sleep?<br>A: Well  a little while ago  I started chatting online  and I was always up until very late hours of the morning speaking to them  only because I wanted to  no other reason. Well  I did it  continuously for several months  and now  whenever I try to go to bed earlier  (even if im absolutely shattered) I just can't get to sleep :( My sleeping pattern is REALLY messed up  and although I wouldn't go back to change it  I still need to sort something out  but I don't know what. I have been to the doctors about it  several times  and the final time  he eventually perscribed me some medication. Thing is  it was a pretty heavy dose of something that was VERY addictive and caused a lot of bad side effects. I started to take them  and they didn't make ay difference at all. I finished the packet  and they made no change to my sleeping that there wasn't a point in continuing and getting hooked on anything dangerous. So all in all  im pretty screwed :( I go to bed  perhaps 3am  but I don't get to sleep until about 5/6am and im normally woken up not long after with my family leaving to go to work. So I go back to sleep  im woken again  and this continues until I actually get up a few hours later.  I think this needs to be sorted :( I need my life back :'(
8194,0,0.0,Q: How coool it was to meet Kathryn and Lily ?<3<br>A: Beyond cool! They are such normal people though  nothing has gone to their heads  and you can imagine them being friends rather than someone famous and as a result intimidating :) A bit of a blur though...
8195,0,0.0,Q: how did u family react to u likeing girls ?<br>A: Well mum has since tried to set me up with guys  and she constantly talks about me &quot;happily married with my husband&quot;  so she is still in that denial phase. Not good when I initially told her. My dad  has forgotten I think  either that or he didn't take it seriously in the first place. If im honest  to me  my parents have nothing to do with my sexuality  its my issue  my life :)
8196,0,0.0,Q: how did u know u liked girls<br>A: My friends used to talk about boys  and I never felt anything they were describing until I realised  everything they were saying  for me applied to certain girls :/ In the beginning  mainly odd celebrities  but once I was open to it and I had tuned in  I realised it could be anyone (not necessarily famous) :)
8197,0,0.0,Q: how different they are...hmmm odd :-P<br>A: LOADS! Its weird  why can't we all have the same system? That would make it so much easier :)
8198,0,0.0,Q: how do you act when you&#039;re angry (like are you the &#039;silent treatment&#039; person or do you just have to yell a bit.. or something else?)?<br>A: Hmmm  it depends on what it was. I am one of those people who stay quiet for a while then kind of explode a bit :S It really depends on who I was with and whether I would feel comfortable talking things out  you know? Hopefully it would involve exploding that way :)
8199,0,0.0,Q: how do you act when.. you&#039;re in love? <333<br>A: Im really smitten with that person  and I give everything I possibly could to that person to make them feel as special as I do for being with them :) As you know by now  Im a romantic kind of person  so I would give everything I had into it :) Other than that  pretty damn happy when Im with them  and really mopey when I miss them :'(
8200,0,0.0,Q: how do you act when.. you&#039;re sad? :&#039;-(<br>A: Thats when I go quiet  definitely. I probably give pretty short answers too  its usually easy to tell (if you know me well enough) that I am upset about something. Either that  or I come ranting to you <3
8201,0,0.0,Q: how do you choose between your head and your heart<br>A: I don't know im afraid. Some people follow their heart  some people their head. I guess it all depends on which you think will work out best.
8202,0,0.0,Q: how do you find the up side when everything is down?<br>A: I just look for things that make me happy or I can escape to :) No matter how bad things can get  there is always something that can cheer you up. So I guess its about concentrating on those things? :)
8203,0,0.0,Q: How does it feel knowing so many girls want you?<br>A: The don't. You have just been mistaken :)
8204,0,0.0,Q: how does the UK school/education system work?? its different from the US... now this is a boring question...<br>A: Okay  so basically. When we start education (at about 4/5 years) we start primary school  which goes from reception  then year one  through to year 6 (all completed yearly). Then  we go to secondary school  starting in year 7 (age 10/11) all the way through to year 11 (15/16). In years 3  6 and 9  we complete 'SATS' which are like little test things determining how well we are doing in school. In year 11  we complete our GCSE's  which are the qualifications that a lot of employees look at when interviewing you. Then we finished school and go to college to study a-levels for 2 years  generally before people go onto university to study a chosen subject at age 17/18 for a final degree. How about yours? Its always confused me :P lol
8205,0,0.0,Q: how early do you get up in the morning?<br>A: Hmmm  it depends day to day  generally on when I fall to sleep. Perhaps 11:30 or something? But I wake up before  and just lie there lol!
8206,0,0.0,Q: How far would you go with someone that you just met? haha ;-)<br>A: hahaha! These questions today :P If im honest  im not one of those people who would sleep with anyone and everyone there and then. I like to get to know people before  lets say 'getting intimate' with them. Its hard to say  because you connect differently with different people  and I think you can judge a lot from a first meeting  so it completely depends on the person and my feelings for them :)
8207,0,0.0,Q: how in the hell are you still single?!<br>A: Lol  thank you!!! You tell me? What's wrong with me? There must be a reason right? Perhaps its the insecure issue :( lol <33333
8208,0,0.0,Q: How is the weather right now? i mean obviously its night.. but aside from that.. can you see the moon and stars? :-)<br>A: I don't have a clue! Its dark  and all the blinds are closed. Im not walking outside by myself to check  unless you join me? :P
8209,0,0.0,Q: How is the weather right now?<br>A: Well we have had a lot of rain the past couple of days  but for now  its steady :) Still wet and cold out though :(
8210,0,0.0,Q: How late do you usually go to sleep?<br>A: Ummm  well I go to bed any time from about 3 until 5  and im usually asleep at about 6/7? I suffer from REALLY bad insomnia  hence why Im always up late at night  and why I normally sleep on in the day :)
8211,0,0.0,Q: How many did I ask? :-P Hahaha.<br>A: I think it was about 40/50? lol!  but my Twitter update limit ran out in between  so im answering all now :D
8212,0,0.0,Q: How many floors does your home have?<br>A: 2 floors :) Well three if you include the loft :/
8213,0,0.0,Q: How many in your family? How many siblings do you have? Are you the oldest or the youngest of those siblings?<br>A: I actually have a really small family. In my close family  its me  my sister (who is 23) and our parents. Then I have one gran  2 uncles  one aunt and 2 cousins. Although I hardly see both of my uncles  they aren't really bothered about keeping in contact with the family  so eventually we have sort of lost touch :( I haven't seen one of my cousins for about 4/5 years. He got married  and ended up forgetting about his own family to move in on his wifes family and friends. So basically  that leaves my nan  cousin and aunt are the only people I really see. Its pretty sad :( My cousin  her dad (one of the uncles) also treated her really badly as a child (deliberately left her out of things  made her eat at a separate table over dinner  sent her to bed when she did nothing wrong  wouldn't let her go outside etc) so its another reason why the family don't worry about the uncle excusing himself from the family.  Both of my other grandparents have passed away :( Grampy when I was 3  Nan when I was 5 (and I still remember that :'() and 'Pop' (grandfather) when I was 15. So  a pretty small loose family unit I would say :(
8214,0,0.0,Q: How many languages can you speak and what are they?<br>A: Well I studied French and German at school  but I have forgotten pretty much all of it. I would like to speak French and Spanish fluently though  I have just never gotten around to learning them properly :)
8215,0,0.0,Q: how many more questions do you have to answer  i bet you&#039;ll be here all night?<br>A: 46 in total..lol. I also promised someone else LOADDDDSSSS to make up for all these. So yes  all night :)
8216,0,0.0,N/a
8217,0,0.0,Q: How many questions did I ask this time? (not including the multiple questions in a question) How many questions are you going to ask me in return? :-P<br>A: Hmmm  I think you asked about 15/20? Its about fair I do the same right? :D
8218,0,0.0,Q: How many sugars do you put in tea?<br>A: I don't put sugar in my tea :) I use sweetener though  like 3 :)

8223,0,0.0,Q: How many times have you been to the beach?<br>A: Too many :S I don't even like the beach that much  thats why it's too many. The first time I ever stepped foot on a beach  I burst out crying because I didn't like the sand between my toes LOL! I was rather young though  so cut me some slack :P
8224,0,0.0,Q: how much for a pint and a poke?<br>A: Stop using Skins quotes :P
8225,0,0.0,Q: How oddly similar are we? :-D<br>A: I think we're very similar :) I mean we agree on a lot of things  and have the same personality traits. Obviously Im slightly older than you are  but we still have a lot in common. Our views and values appear to be the same too  along with our priorities in life :) You are a slightly late version of me HAHA!
8226,0,0.0,Q: How often *would you like to* go out on dates?<br>A: I don't know really. Im not one of those people that NEEDS to go out to have a good time. Sure  I Would like to go out with my partner  but staying in  cuddling up watching a good movie is just as nice :) It all depends on what mood im in (not  like that ;) lol) and if there was somewhere I really wanted to go. Im pro originality lol  do something different than your average 'dinner date' :)
8227,0,0.0,Q: How often do you eat food?<br>A: Whenever I get hungry I suppose.
8228,0,0.0,Q: How often do you really &quot;go out&quot;?<br>A: Go out? In the sense leave my house? lol Probably every day  unless im ill or something :(
8229,0,0.0,Q: How old are you?  I was just wondering...<br>A: 20 and a half :)
8230,0,0.0,Q: how old are you?<br>A: 20 :)
8231,0,0.0,Q: how old do you feel most of the time?<br>A: I guess I just feel my age  I don't know how it feels to feel old  so I suppose 20?
8232,0,0.0,Q: how old do you want to be when you die?<br>A: Depends on how wrinkly I get. No pre 80s shit though :) If Im one of those old ladies still able to line-dance and pee by themselves  Im all for the old age!
8233,0,0.0,Q: How old were you when you had your first girlfriend/boyfriend?<br>A: Thats kind of hard to answer actually. Remember 'Time for Coffee?'  my fanfic? Well  that was based on something I had with a girl from work  so its hard to say really. Technically we weren't dating  but there was obviously something there.
8234,0,0.0,Q: How old were you when you went on your first date? How was it?<br>A: I have never really been taken on a date lol. Call it sad  but Im not a big one for relationships and I have never had anything serious  so the term 'date' hasn't been big in my life :(
8235,0,0.0,Q: How romantic are you?<br>A: I would like to think im pretty romantic. I don't think you need much to be romantic or spontaneous  its just about being original and making something special for the other half.
8236,0,0.0,Q: How tall are you?<br>A: 5'11&quot; :) Pretty tall  hence not being able to wear heels :P Hey  at least it means im usually stable :D
8237,0,0.0,Q: How the fuck do you own 30 pairs of jeans?!<br>A: Oh trust me  thats nothing! You should see my entire wardrobe :S Im such a girl when it comes to clothing lol. 30 pairs of jeans? Well  I don't even wear jeans  so if i'm honest  its completely pointless in owning them.
8238,0,0.0,Q: how was your day? <3<br>A: It was okay thanks :) Managed to get out of work earlier than expected  so that was nice :) Not the most eventful days  but it could have been worse :) Im sorry to have heard about yours :'(
8239,0,0.0,Q: how was your evening without me? well im back now so technically not &#039;without me&#039;  but before i got back? haha :-)<br>A: Well it wasn't too great. Apart from feeling REALLY terrible  I have had a few problems over twitter (most of which I have told you over a question  near the end I think). I have been being driven slightly insane  but you're going to find out why in a bit :) Anyway  im off to bed  so I shall speak to a certain someone tomorrow! Until then  I SHALL MISS YOUUUUU :( Sleep well when you go to bed :D <333
8240,0,0.0,Q: How would you ask someone out?<br>A: Im not really the person who does the asking out  if im completely honest. I don't have very much self confidence (as you should know from reading my answers already)  so its not a move I would generally do. I leave it up to the other person  hence why I am probably still single lol. I could ask them out to do something  but I wouldn't strictly say &quot;want to go for coffee?&quot; type of ask out  that just isn't me :)

I remember when I started crying in one of my managers offices and they were just sat there like &quot;..........&quot;. Its like  &quot;no  this isn't embarrassing at all. Just sit there and stare&quot;. I was going through a hard patch  hence crying in the first place lol. But  in actual response to yours  Im not like that :) If someone is crying  I would do my best to comfort them  and that of course includes you <3

8307,0,0.0,Q: I still cant believe you know Georgia... and you&#039;ve met the skins cast... :-O anyone else i should know about? who was your favorite to meet? who was the nicest(&amp;who wasnt)? who was absolutely nothing like you expected them to be like? who was the cutest?<br>A: Ummm  I don't think so lol. Saw Simon Cowell about a month ago. Ermmmm  the nicest people? Well I am obviously biased  but I think I would Say Lily  with Kat close behind :) Lily is SOOOO down to earth  and I Really could imagine myself being good friends with her in real life. As for Kat  she was lovely too  but Kat has a VERY cool exterior  and because she gets a REAL lot of people talking to her  she has a lot to deal with  you know what I mean? When I met Kaya  I didn't actually like her. Both times :( the first time  I was outside the cinema  and Luke  Kat  Lily and Kaya were just going in. I called out &quot;Kat!&quot; and she looked around  really shocked! LOL! Then I spoke to them  and Kaya shouted &quot;come on! The film has already started!&quot; and Lily followed her inside the theater. Luke and Kat were stood there  and we were all just looking at each other  not knowing what to do. I said &quot;don't worry. ITs okay  enjoy your film&quot; and Both Luke and Kat looked at each other  replying &quot;no no no&quot; and walked back over to me :D I LOVED IT! That was SUCH a nice feeling! Knowing they were missing their film to come and talk to me! So anyway  I spoke to Luke first  then I started talking to Kat and Luke went on inside. Then I was saying how much I loved Emily  etc etc etc (crazy fangirl behaviour lol) and she said thanks  did a cute thumbs up thing  I said bye  and she did a cute wave. She was adorable then! Anyway  the second time I met Kaya  it was at the Skins House. She had been in the VIP area upstairs ALL night  and she had just come down  for about 5 minutes. I saw her  and walked over asking for a photo. She was talking to someone  so I just stood there and patiently waited. Then she stopped  and I tapped her on the shoulder. Nothing. So she started talking to someone else. I waited until she finished  and tapped again. Nothing. Then she started talking again  I waited  tapped again. Nothing. So I started saying &quot;kaya?&quot;  nothing. Said it again  nothing :( Then she started to walk away  up some stairs  back into the VIP room  and she was running up pretty fast so I couldn't follow :( Later on  I saw her again  and I asked her to sign my magazine cover. She said yes  and then she had just signed a 'k' and then someone walked into her  causing her to smudge the pen/marker. At this point  she hasn't even signed half her name  but she just said 'sorry' and walked off  leaving me stood there with a magazine with the entire cast's signatures on  and a 'k' over Kaya's photo. I wasn't too impressed if im honest  especially because I wasn't being pushy :( anyway  I did eventually manage to get a quick photo with her  but it was a bit of a job to get there :( Hmm  the cutest? Probably Meg :) She has quite low self asteem actually! When I met her at the filming  she was just sat by herself  watching the filming. Then we went over and started chatting to her  and she was saying how she had been there 10 hours and they hadn't even used her in anything yet :( Then we had a photo with her  and looking back at it  she was like &quot;OMG! I look terrible!&quot; even though she looked adorable :) Then there was when I met her at the house party. She was pretty sweet then too. I think she was a bit nervous actually because in the beginning  she was walking around holding Lukes hand and it was just so sweet to see :) Then  she went outside and was smoking practically the entire night lol. She was a drowned little rat! She was drenched! But still looked adorable :)

As much as I love Katie being her confident cocky side  it was nice to see her actually fragile for a while. I know she was in Ep 9 of last season  but that was different. She actually felt vunerable  and all I was routing for  is the &quot;Katie fucking Fitch&quot; back :P It will be interesting to see how she is in the next few episodes. Considering she doesn't think she is 'her' anymore  she is having an identity crisis  and I would like to see how that pans out :)

8376,0,0.0,Q: If we believed that life wanted more than anything else to simply serve our hearts dersires   asking on a daily basis -how do you want to be loved today - how would you reply?<br>A: The think with romance  I think something that can kill the spontaneity in a relationship  is asking your partner &quot;What should we do? How can I make you happy? Tell me and I will do it&quot;. Apart from the obvious answer that makes most people happy ;) its not romantic to tell someone how you want to be treated. I would feel much better  if my partner made an effort and figured it out. Even if they didn't figure out exactly what I wanted to do  I would love them that much more for making the effort to show me that they love me. Does this make sense?

8386,0,0.0,Q: If you could have a super-power  what super-power would it be? why? :-)<br>A: Hmmm  the power to turn invisible? Then I would go all Veronica Mars on unsuspecting victims... Orrrrrr The power to read minds. Not scarily like 'Earshot' from Buffy  but be able to home in on one person  and turn it off it I wanted. There goes all insecurity right? :D No more fake friends. Although  the truth can hurt. Okay  lets go back to the invisible one :)
8387,0,0.0,Q: If you could have any animal as a pet  what would you have?<br>A: A BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN :D

8390,0,0.0,Q: If you feel stressed what would you do to reduce it?<br>A: It depends what the stress is over.

8393,0,0.0,Q: If you had a billion dollars  what would you do with it?<br>A: Woahhh? A billion dollars? Well  I would make sure I am settled with everything I would need  plus my family and friends. Then I would give a lot to charities  to smaller charities  because the mainstream ones get a lot from exposure  then put the rest into an account for future family members. I wouldn't want to be that kind of person where it changes who I am. But still  I wouldn't mind it ;)

8401,0,0.0,Q: If you were a tree  what tree would you be?? :-P<br>A: A tree? Well  I wasn't aware that trees can tell the difference between things  but I see where you are going with this. I would say a Willow tree  only because I love to be protective of the ones that I love  and as a Willow  I can spread my branches and give shelter to those who need it :) (EXCUSE CHEESY ANSWER  thanks ;))
8402,0,0.0,Q: If you were the opposite sex for one day  what would you look like and what would you do?<br>A: Ermmmmm  can't say I have ever thought about that question. So  I would say beefy like Mr T!! Phwarrrrrr! ;) and go around giving out free chocolate bars for sex ;) HAHA!

8405,0,0.0,Q: If your friend was cheating on their lover  would you tell them to stop?<br>A: I don't think it would really be my place to get involved  but it would completely depend on their lover. If I thought  they treated my friend badly in the first place  I probably would just stay out of it  whereas if they didn't deserve it  I would try and intervene and tell my friend to sort herself out  and tell them  or break it off. It's not fair to lie either way :(

8420,0,0.0,Q: in general opinion on motorbikes? mopeds? good bad? fun? comment in any way... ;-)<br>A: I think they can be fun BUT the only worry I have about them  is some people don't wear the right gear and I get a bit concerned about that. Especially if its people that I really care about or love :( I do think they are pretty fun though  and my sister did have a moped before she learned to drive a car. She gave it up about 2 weeks into passing her test lol! So apart from being concerned  they are rather cool :D
8421,0,0.0,Q: In Katie&#039;s episode of series 4 we learnt that Katie&#039;s name is actually Kathryn (might not be spelt that way but it&#039;s all good).

8423,0,0.0,Q: In your opinion  what is the best thing about being a girl? :-)<br>A: Ummm  probably kind of the same as the last answer  in a weird way. Sensitivity? Only because  being a girl and someone doing something for you  either a friend  family member or a lover  you appreciate it so much more. Also  being a girl (this is going to sound terrible) but you are able to handle things better  and are able to understand how a certain person is feeling or thinking  and you can react to it in the right way. If that makes sense? Men  again some  not all  are less sensitive  and don't understand why that person is crying or angry  but being a girl. You just know :)
8424,0,0.0,Q: In your opinion  what is the worst thing about being a girl?<br>A: Well apart from the obvious  having children  the pain of giving birth  periods  etc etc. Sensitivity I think. Just because  I know im a very sensitive person  and I really hate how I let things upset me sometimes. A lot of men  not all  but the majority  don't let things bother them so much as women do. So definitely that :(
8425,0,0.0,Q: independent but you live at home... explain?<br>A: Well I am independent in the sense that I don't care what other people think (about certain things anyway) and I don't let anything else influence what I wear or say.  A lot of people say my dress sense is &quot;unique&quot; and I would agree lol. I still live at home  only because I have no other choice. Im only 20  and you will see what its like to be still pretty young and not have the biggest income. If I moved out  I would be paying rent for somewhere  but I couldn't even afford to live. So whats the point in moving out? I will in time  well in september. So its going to be a nice break :) When I am at home  im independent in the sense that I like to be in my bedroom or by myself doing things (not that Im a loner lol) I just find it easier to concentrate on something if no one else is there. You know what I mean? I sound completely weird don't I??? O_O lol!
8426,0,0.0,Q: inny or an outy?<br>A: Inny

8430,0,0.0,Q: Is family important to you?<br>A: YES! Definitely! I think family is very much  what you can make of it  but still. They are the people that have lived to bring you up  you need to respect and be thankful for that  even if I don't get along with them all the time.
8431,0,0.0,Q: Is forever over now?<br>A: Forever will never be over...
8432,0,0.0,Q: Is having a crush on john bishop wrong?Lol :-P<br>A: Totally not! Only if you have a crush on his on screen daughters  then yes. Fuck it   John Bishop is totally hot! Not to me  obviously  but in general XD

Well  unless its a celebrity one  because I think everyone has them lol.
8437,0,0.0,Q: is it possible to be cute and drop dead gorgeous?<br>A: Yes I think so  definitely! well  yourself for one thing :P Don't even go there by saying you arent! If you saw yourself in a bar  you would SO chat yourself up  don't even deny it :P

8441,0,0.0,Q: is love eternal?<br>A: I would like to think so yes :)
8442,0,0.0,Q: Is revenge sometimes justified?<br>A: Yes. I think so yes  in different ways too. If someone gets you  why can't you return the favour? I think revenge  can show people something too  if that makes sense? Shows you how something feels. Take Naomily for example  Emily kissing that girl  it showed Naomi (in a really small sense) how Emily is feeling  even though it doesn't compare  Emily blatantly did it on purpose to get back at her  and I would probably do the same in her position. So  yes  I think it can be :)

8445,0,0.0,Q: Is there a such thing as a perfect relationship for you?<br>A: Ummm  I think the term 'perfect relationship' varies for everyone and anyone depending on their mood at the time. You know? If I were to answer this  I would say someone who loved me for who I was  and vice versa. Someone who gets you  who unterstands your feelings and needs  and treats you with the respect you treat them with. Someone romantic  cute  witty  honest  trusting etc lol. how about you?
8446,0,0.0,Q: is there anywhere more secluded where you will post the answers that escape this form?<br>A: Not that im aware of.

8448,0,0.0,Q: Is your hair naturally curly?<br>A: It is naturally quite wavy yes :) It goes REALLY curly if it gets wet when im out or something  and I hate it when It gets rained on  because I can't sort it out until I am back home :( Anyway  normally I don't really do much to my hair. I always blow dry it  kind of so it goes a messy wavy kind of look. I don't use any straightners or curlers on it (very often anyway) I just let it do its thannnnng :) Probably why it is in such good condition then :) I style it occasionally obviously  but more often than not  its left messy :) But like styled messy  not like  trampy or anything LOL!
8449,0,0.0,Q: Is your hair soft?<br>A: It is actually :) I remember when I went to the hairdressers to actually ask about bleaching my hair  and they said &quot;but your hair is so soft and shiny!

8453,0,0.0,Q: It doesn&#039;t like you.<br>A: Does this face look like it cares? To me  this face looks like it's smiling...
8454,0,0.0,Q: It is more worthwhile and satisfying to improve the world or appreciate the world?<br>A: Appreciate the world. To change something is a HECK of a big deal  and its not always achievable  which means you would never be satisfied. So  to appreciate it the way it is  means you would always get something out of it :)

8577,0,0.0,Q: opinion on s4 emily? naomi?<br>A: Hmmm  well I think Naomi deserves everything that she is getting  especially seeing as she isn't doing anything to win Emily back. She cheated on her  said &quot;I'll do anything&quot; then that was it. There wasn't any making Emily feel special  she was just moping about :S BUT  I think they both need to talk it out now. I think  with Emily  its going too far and they just need to sort it out  even argue it out  but at least get things said and out in the open. They are trying to act as though things are fine  even though both of them know it isn't. I think it is driving them both insane  and perhaps thats why Emily is looking at Mandy  maybe as a way out? I know for sure they are going to sort everything out  but I am disappointed it is going to be so late in the series :(
8578,0,0.0,Q: p.s.> yuor car sounds really cool!!! :-) and sooo pretty.<br>A: Thank you <333333 I love it :D Butttt  my dad was saying  when I go to Brighton  there isn't really a point in taking my car  because its going to cost me about u00a31000 to have it on the road (not including petrol) and Im not really going to be using it much. So he said about not taking it to Brighton with me  and just using the busses and trains to get about. This bloody sucks  BUT then he had the bloody cheek to say &quot;we might as well sell yours. You aren't going to be using it for nearly a year  I will look into putting it online&quot; WTF DAD!!! YOU ARE NOT SELLING IT! I WANT IT WHEN I COME HOME!!!! :'(

8619,0,0.0,Q: Should your partner also be your best friend?<br>A: I think its important yes  BUT it is also important to have a close friend outside the relationship. Just because if anything ever happened and you went through a 'rough patch'  sometimes other people can make you see things clearer. So  I think they can  but to have someone else outside the relationship is even more important.

8634,0,0.0,Q: Some people have their babies names planned out. Do you? What do you want? A boy? 2 girls? 2 boys 2 girls? Any ideas? :) If it was with a girl  some people want to have them themselves  would you want to have the children or your partner?<br>A: Stealing my questions now are we? :P Well I haven't thought much about the first few  the how many I want  their names etc. I don't know if I want boys or girls either  probably girls  but it doesn't really matter to me. I know I definitely want to have children  but in the relationship  I can see myself more as the caring person  so I don't know if I would have the children necessarily. I suppose you can have a child each (keep popping them out ;) lol) but  I don't know if I really want to actually have one. Its hard to say really  im not in a position at the moment where I want kids here and now  definitely not  so I guess I can comment more near the time :)

8668,0,0.0,Q: tell me your life story?<br>A: Oh god! Okay  ready for an essay from me this time? :P  So  I was born. Which I don't remember  otherwise that would have been a sight! I open my eyes  to see and hear &quot;pushhhhhhhhh&quot; and a little slit with light coming through-ahem! I shall start a little later :P  I went to primary school  and all through the 6 years  I was such a good girl  and I was even encouraged by a teacher to do something wrong because I saw so innocent.  I got bullied pretty badly through the years 4-6 and eventually I started to stick up for myself towards the end  so they dropped it and left me alone. I won :D Anyway  In year 6 I had my first (and little did I know  last) crush on a boy. I told my mum  and she got really excited that i was 'growing up'. Well  this crush was really big (or at least I thought it was at the time) and I Remember at our end of year prom thing  he asked me out. I got really embarrassed and I ended up saying no (which I kicked myself for in the end). I started secondary school  and my parents wanted me to go to the school that my sister goes to. It is SUCH a good school  but I refused because all my friends were going to my local one  and I wanted to go with them. Well I started school fine  and got along really well with everyone. About a year later  the people who I went to school with  aka my friends from primary school  started to pick on me. It got really bad again  and I ended up having no one.  I met another friend  Laura and she helped me through everything. Eventually we became best friends  and the other group of friends now started to pick on her because she was friends with me. One day  I thought enough is enough  and I went to a teacher about the bullying. She phoned up both of our parents  and let them know what was happening. About a week later  once things had started to calm down a little  the girl who bullied me  her mum phoned up the school  saying that I was now bullying her! I was called into a meeting with the bully herself and another teacher to sort this out. This teacher was crap  and basically believed everything the other girl was saying  just because she was coming off &quot;sweet and innocent&quot;. My mum heard about this  and called up the bullys mum to have a chat with her. She came around our house  and was trying to pick a fight with my mum outside  all while I was listening to them argue while hiding under the stairs. She left  and my mum refused to engage in a fight over something that could be sorted without parental violence. Nothing was ever sorted  and I think the girl (the bully) got a little scared about being found out and her mums temper  that she finally left me alone. So  I was happy again :)  I finished secondary school pretty happy. I was top of most of my classes  and i even was entered into this british art competition by my art teacher  which I won :D I loved art at school  and every lunch and after school  my art teacher let us have her room so I could sit and carry on with my work. Because I loved it so much! she wouldn't let anyone else in their  except for me and my friends  because I was her no1 student :) Well  life was good until I started to become confused about my sexuality. I didn't think much about it at first  only that all my friends were talking about 'boys' and I couldn't agree or relate to anything that they were saying.  Well  I finished school really confused  and went onto college to study further subjects. I grew apart from my old friends  because being in a different college  with a different time table  its awkward to keep in touch so well as you were before. So I made a new circle of friends  and I got really close to one girl in particular. We became best friends  and told eachother everything. About 2 years after being friends  I decided I wanted to tell someone about me being gay  and thought she was the best person to tell. So  I told her  and almost instantly  she abandoned me :( We didn't really speak anymore  and I know it was because I freaked her out  and she didnt want to have a 'lesbian' as her best friend :(  So  I moved on and decided I didn't want to have a friend like her if something as small as sexuality would ruin our relationship. So anyway  I started my art foundation year  and I FUCKING LOVED IT!!! It was one of the best times of my life  and Idid love the end parts in particular. I went through that phase  of not being bothered to go  and I did take a bit of time off (usually to sleep on at home lol)  but I still came out with one of the best grades out of a couple of hundred people. So I was really proud :D  Anyway  once finishing that year  I didn't know what I wanted to continue on to university  so I decided to take a gap year  and build up a little money and sort my head out with what I actually wanted to do. in the year I was working for my parents a bit  property developing and stuff. The year turned into 2  and I kind of went astray from any dreams that I really wanted. Which is why I did something about it  got my ass in gear and applied to Brighton Film School. Well  I got in  as you know  and that pretty much leads me up to now :)  Soooo  I AM SO SORRY about this essay :P I hope you haven't fallen asleep  and I sincerely appologise if you have :( So  in response to yours  you don't have to apologise about it being long! and it wasn't boring  its interesting to hear everything that has gone on with your life. I would consider you as a friend too  so that means I want to know about everything :D

It doesnt grow. It kind of feels like they chopped the 1st one in half  added more video and stuck it back together again. There was no growth or development :(

8690,0,0.0,Q: Think of the last person who you really knew that died. You have the chance to give them 1 hour of life back  but you have to give one year of your life. Do you?<br>A: This is a difficult question. Even if there wasn't a year of my life in the balance  I don't know if I would. When you lose the people that you love  its so so painful  and to get them back  even for a moment  you know you are going to go through all that pain again. Is it worth it? So no  I probably wouldn't :(
8691,0,0.0,Q: Think of the last time you were REALLY angry<br>A: Work today! :( A group of 5 guests walked out without paying their bill  and I wasn't around at that precise moment to stop them  so they left  getting off scott free. I spoke to my manager  and he said that  &quot;they are my responsibility so I need to pay the bill with my own money&quot;. The bill was u00a380  and they were having a laugh if they thought I was paying that with my own cash! I can't keep an eye on my tables 100% of the time  because 99% of the time  I am doing things for them  which do involve walking to other areas of the restaurant. So anyway  this sparked a huge argument between me and my manager  and I wasn't backing down  and giving in resulting in myself being out of pocket. It was out of my control  and the company generates so much money  so why should they use their staff to continue generating profits? Well  I was SO SO SO angry  and I eventually went to the staff toilets to have a little cry due to the frustration of the situation.  It was sorted in the end  and because I didn't back down and agree to give it to them  they let it go lol. Like they should have too!
8692,0,0.0,Q: Thinking about colors of the rainbow  what color are you? Your friends? Your enemies?<br>A: Ummm  I would say perhaps green?  Because im quite a cheerful person  but sometimes I can be pushed  and I may become down about something becoming 'blue' ;)  OR  on the other hand  im easily cheered up about something  becoming a happy yellow! I have no idea lol  im just thinking logically :P
8693,0,0.0,Q: This is my rifle  There are many like it but this one is mine  Without my rifle I am nothing  Without me my rife is nothing!!<br>A: Isn't that from a Family Guy episode?

8695,0,0.0,Q: to be  or not to be??<br>A: To be...definitely. Sounds better :)
8696,0,0.0,Q: toast with butter  or jam?<br>A: Okay  here is my toast routine  and it has to be precise :) When the toast pops up  it has to be buttered STRAIGHT away  so that the butter melts and then you eat while still warm :) So the answer (after the essay about toast)  butter :)
8697,0,0.0,Q: tom-boys or girly-girls?<br>A: GIRLY-GIRLS! Definitely :D I don't really understand lesbians that fancy girls that look like boys. I have no problem with it  obviously  I just personally don't get it. I like girls  so I like girls that look like girls lol. :)

8712,0,0.0,Q: weirdest person you&#039;ve ever met?<br>A: Because of the job that I do  I am constantly meeting and engaging with new people. Some of them are nice  some of them...not. Some weird  some eccentric  some rude  some polite. Its hard to put a definition on 'weirdest' and to pin a certain person down. Definitely some of the customers I meet are very weird (if I take it as the 'odd' interpretation)  for example  once I had 2 guys sat down in one of my tables  and one kept staring at me. It was a little offputting  so I tried to avoid them as much as I could. When I was putting their food down  a member of staff (a guy) said bye to me  gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. The guy on my table  stood up  eyed him with the worst look as my friend walked out. He then looked at me and said &quot;he doesn't appreciate your eyes. He looks about 12  pshhhhh&quot;  then sat down and ate. LOL!!! Thats just one weirdo  I meet a lot :P

8714,0,0.0,Q: well i was watchin an interview on afterellen 2day and kat sort of gav away they have a happy ending so i hope its tru but i kind of like seein naomi b jealous i saw the previews 4 nxt week<br>A: YEAH! That part on After Ellen was hilarious! Kat was like &quot;well their is a hap-!&quot; and lily makes a strange &quot;Bzz&quot; ing noise or something! That was too cute for words! lol! So yeah  its probably about showing Naomi how much she really cares (again). But hey  I love jealous Naomi! Only because I think Emily needs to see it. So yeah  sounds good for the ending XD I hope they don't do anything like they did last series though (Gen1 I mean) no one really had happy endings :S It was sad :''''''(
8715,0,0.0,Q: well i&#039;d hope you&#039;d marry me... seeing as we are already planning our honeymoon and all ;-) haha<br>A: Haha! Well technically we are already married  so seeing as you are my newly wed  I had to choose you ;) How about you? Snog  Marry  Avoid? :)
8716,0,0.0,Q: well if you are then you are a very cute idiot... and i love your rambling...<3<br>A: Awwww &quot;A very cute idiot&quot; I have never awwed at being called an idiot before :P <3
8717,0,0.0,Q: Were you named after someone?<br>A: No  I was just named Kelly because my dad liked it. They put a lot of thought into that one didn't then :P But imagine if I was named my mums old surname (which would have been changed to blake once she got married) and then they split up  going back to her former surname. What a shit name! lol
8718,0,0.0,Q: what &#039;religion&#039; are you? are you at all religious? are you spiritual?<br>A: I don't really believe in anything in particular. Im more a mix of views and stuff rather than sticking to any religion exactly.  I was baptised  so technically I am a christian  but im not in the sense that I don't believe in God. Well  I don't not believe  but I don't believe exactly either lol. Im an Athiest I suppose :) How about you? :)
8719,0,0.0,Q: what about poverty?<br>A: Poverty frankly sucks. Don't get me started on this :S Why are places like Africa still in so much debt  when all they do is borrow money from other countries = to pay back other debts  therefore getting themselves worse in the process. Where is good will these days? Why cant 3rd world debt be abolished? As for poverty in other situations. Some people who are lazy and can't be bothered to give a shit  I don't feel for. But the people who are trying to get by  but cant because of tax and loans and owing people shit  what's the point? We are all people  cant we live the same? too many issues for a single post :)
8720,0,0.0,Q: what am i listening to right now?<br>A: Errrrrm  im going to be obvious and say Ellie? lol
8721,0,0.0,Q: What American TV shows do you/did you watch?<br>A: Buffy  Angel  Charmed  The OC  South of Nowhere  Friends. Mostly the high school ones  probably because I can relate to them better :)
8722,0,0.0,Q: What animal do you look like/resemble?<br>A: HAHA! Animal? Ummm  I don't think I really resemble any animals lol. Well the closest would probably be an ape  but thats only because of evolutional purposes  Im not big and hairy! :P lol
8723,0,0.0,Q: What are some of the craziest things you&#039;ve ever done?<br>A: Ummm  I have never been that crazy really. Well  I can't remember  and that may be a good thing lol! I wasn't a boring teenager  but I was never  lets say like Cook (and I know you watch Skins ;) lol). Im not the person to say &quot;don't do this  don't do that&quot;  I do like to try things  but I suppose I have never been &quot;CRAZY-esque&quot; :)
8724,0,0.0,Q: What are the three &#039;nevers&#039; of your life?<br>A: Never Cheat. Never lose hope. Never give in.

8728,0,0.0,Q: what are your addictions? ...like im addicted to tv.. and other things.. :-P<br>A: Im addicted to music  without doubt! and probably twitter and formspring (which is really bad! Your fault :P haha)
8729,0,0.0,Q: What are your parents like?<br>A: Well  my mum is kind of an easy going person BUT she can be REALLY annoying! She always jumps to things  for example &quot;Kelly  feed the animals&quot; &quot;Okay  give me 10 minutes then I will do it&quot; &quot;Okay  but you better  they will die with no food. Rabbits need to be fed every day otherwise they need to go to the vets&quot; &quot;yes  okay mum&quot; &quot;I mean it Kelly. Tonight&quot; &quot;yeah mum! I know&quot; &quot;they will die otherwise&quot; *I ignore* lol  My dad  well he is the opposite really. Things he wants  he gets. He want's something done a certain way  thats how its done. He is pretty argumentative too  which is probably why we clash. I stick up for things that I believe in  so we don't get on like the best of people :( How about yours? :)
8730,0,0.0,Q: what are your terms of endearment?? :-)<br>A: Well I say sweetie  hun  lovely quite a bit. I don't really say babe  not even in the romantic kind of way  its not the nicest of things to be called lol. If I find someone attractive then I call them gorgeous  or beautiful or something :) If I were dating someone  I would probably call them gorgeous a lot lol. I call Bella gorgeous all the time! Because she is just tooooo beautiful for words :D

8732,0,0.0,Q: What are your ultimate goals for the next 5 years? How about 10 years? What can you see yourself doing?<br>A: Well  in 5 years  I would like to see myself having successfully completed the motion picture film course in Brighton  and hopefully I would have made some useful contacts within the filming industry. I would hopefully be starting out in smaller projects (perhaps even as a runner) and by 5 years  would like to see myself having created some successful short films to take to international short film festivals. In 10 years  I would like to see myself having started out in direction or production of small independent films  and starting to settle down with a family :)
8733,0,0.0,Q: What are your views on love at first sight? Possible? Impossible?<br>A: Ummm  I don't know if its possible  but I believe that someone could have STRONG feelings for someone at first sight. For me  falling in love means falling in love with their personality too  and you can't know their personality by just looking at them. So for me  not possible :P
8734,0,0.0,Q: WHAT COLOR IS THE SKY IN BRIZZLE RIGHT NOW?<br>A: Pink.
8735,0,0.0,Q: What conditioner do you use?<br>A: Same  Caude Michel &quot;Colour Protect&quot;. Smells lovely!
8736,0,0.0,Q: what did you think of katie&#039;s episode?<br>A: A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!! :D I think the premature menopause thing was a bit random  I would have liked it to have been something else (she just seems too young for that) but on a good note. I loved the Naomily angst  and Im glad Emily is going all &quot;off the rails&quot; let Naomi know exactly what she has done to her :S Plussss  the Fitches. A whole 45 minute episode around the Fitches. Can't complain at that XD What did you think?
8737,0,0.0,Q: what did you use to dye your hair red?<br>A: Live XXL Hair colour in &quot;Red Passion&quot; :) Although  I used a garnier nutrisse browny colour as a base.
8738,0,0.0,Q: What different colors have your hair been?<br>A: Ummmm  blonde  brown  red  purple and pink :) Soon going back to blonde (bleach) but still a natural-ish colour :)
8739,0,0.0,Q: what do you call a cob down in Brizzle?<br>A: A cob? As in sweetcorn? LOL!
8740,0,0.0,Q: What do you call male ballerinas?<br>A: Mallerinas?
8741,0,0.0,Q: What do you do  when you fall for someone who would never feel the same?<br>A: It depends  you have to ask yourself; is there a chance we could ever be something? If the answer is yes  then thats a good start. You need to get to know that person and then go from there.  If the answer is &quot;not a chance!&quot; then  its really shit  but you need to stop yourself from falling any harder than you already have. I know its hard to do  and its much easier for someone else to say &quot;get over them&quot; because its a fucking hard thing to do! To get over someone  especially when you have fallen hard  it really hurts  but you need to catch it before it ends up getting worse. You know? If you know there definitely isn't a chance between you  and you know that you are ready for a relationship  its probably best to find someone else and concentrate your feelings on them instead. If you are willing to let your feelings (for the other person go)  involving yourself with someone can let them melt away. Anyway  its never easy  and to persue them can be an easier way out  but it all depends on how strong you are  and the person you have fallen for. Okay  essay answer. Good luck :)
8742,0,0.0,Q: what do you do if you know someone is hiding something from you?<br>A: It depends on what it is  if its something that involves or affects you  then you call them out on it. If its something that is personal to them  then let them come to you in their own time. Either way  give them time to come to you about it  and then resort to the above option after you've given them a chance to explain. I don't know if that really helps?
8743,0,0.0,Q: What do you do if you love somebody but you know that they don&#039;t like you in the same way?<br>A: Well it pretty much sucks to be honest. Its happened to me before  and its really hard to deal with. I think rather than giving up  make sure there is no chance with them. If there is  then go for it! You have nothing to lose. If there isn't a chance I think then you need to try and think about all the negative things about that person  to try and snap yourself out of it  at least until some of the pains wears off :(
8744,0,0.0,Q: what do you do when you get nervous/anxious?<br>A: Whenever something important is out of my control. Like  if something has happened in work  and im going to be in trouble for example ;) Or an interview  because you have no control over the situation (apart from how you come across) it can be bloody scary! :(
8745,0,0.0,Q: What do you eat/drink when you go to the cinema?<br>A: I normally drink water  and eat....I guess revels? If I eat anything  its maltesers or Revels :)
8746,0,0.0,Q: What do you label youself as?<br>A: Individual? :)
8747,0,0.0,Q: what do you like better  asking or answering?<br>A: Probably both  depending on my mood :)
8748,0,0.0,Q: What do you like most about girls?<br>A: Well  obviously im gay  so I can't comment about things on guys  but girls. I love how feminine they can be (not in a Paris or Nicole way  GOD NO) but how a girl can be all &quot;does my bum look big in this?&quot; or &quot;what colour dress?&quot;  its just rather cute  lol. Also  girls are pretty hot. What can I say ;) and AGAIN  the sensitivity thing. A girl can get you more than a guy can  so I think to understand your partner in a relationship  is pretty damn important :)

DEFINITELY telling someone else. Only because  if someone is telling you how they feel  at least you have the control of the situation  and you can control how you react. However  if you are telling someone you love them  you have completely put yourself out there  and have no input on where the conversation goes next. Its all about having the control of the situation  and even if you don't feel the same  at least you aren't putting your heart on the line :)

8780,0,0.0,Q: What is the first thing you notice about people?<br>A: Probably their eyes.

So  the next day  I got down this polystyrene head thing that I had  drew eyes on it with eyeliner  and pulled out this fake black wig I had from a fancy dress thing and dressed the wig with it. I then pulled out a floaty white dress thing that I had in my wardrobe  and kind of draped it over the head  making it look like a person. I then hung the head up  in a really odd angle in my parents cupboard under the stairs. When my mum came home  I called her and asked her to get me a bottle of drink from the cupboard  and she said yes. Me and my dad were waiting for the scream  and she returned with the bottle of drink  having not made a sound. Me and my dad were stunned  and asked her if she had seen &quot;it&quot;. &quot;Seen what?&quot; she replied....total and utter fail....lol
8784,0,0.0,Q: What is the stupidest thing you&#039;ve done because someone dared you to? :-D<br>A: Well  it may not be that stupid  but I will always remember it. All through school  I was always the good girl who never got into trouble. I remember during secondary school  in year 8 (which is about age 11/12) I was on a lunch break and I and all my friends bought a plate of chips for dinner. We were sat eating them in the cafeteria  and people started throwing their chips at us  so my friends started throwing them back  but I refused to join in because I didn't want to get into trouble. Anyway  after much persuasion from my friends  I decided to throw ONE chip to get them off my back. I did  and guess what happened? The teacher saw me  NO ONE else  just me  and I got sent to detention for a week. I was so pissed! lol! Everyone found it funny bar me. Not good...lol

8816,0,0.0,Q: what is your style?<br>A: My style? You mean with hair  make-up  clothing etc? Shall I answer all? lol So hair style  i'm not one of those people who like their hair to look perfect all the time. On occasion  yeah I like to style it but im not anal about it being perfect. I absolutely LOVE messy hair  so I use the natural wave thats in my hair  to create a messy and  kind of bed-head look. I use more hairspray than I probably should  but I like the end effect :) My make-up style  I prefer a natural make-up look for daytime  for example a little eyeliner and gold tone eye shadows. For evening or clubs (depending on my clothing) I LOVE a black smokey eye look (only when its done properly) so I might do something with dark eyeshadows and black makeup  but keep a natural base and nude lips. My clothing...well...do you have a year? lol I don't really go by what things say in magazines or in the fashion world at all. I like to wear what I want  and I don't give a shit if anyone else doesn't like it. I suppose in Skins sense (to refer it to someone) I wear a lot of Effy kind of inspired clothes (slashes  white/black  chains etc) but I like to mix it with different prints and/or colours. Imagine a mix of Effy  Naomi and Emily  and you have my kind of style lol. I once wore my satin dressing gown out as a jacket LOL! It was to a Skins House Party actually  and its blue and a floral pattern  you may have seen it :) So all in all  fuck other people  look how you want to look :)
8817,0,0.0,Q: What is your zodiac sign?<br>A: Leo the lion....RAWRRRRRRR...

I had to deliver something like 300 newspapers a week  and they were weekly so it all had to be done on one night :S I didn't love that! Then when I was 15  I quit and got myself a job at the local charity shop. It only paid u00a33.50 an hour  but I was only 15 :) Then at 16  I went to a retail clothing shop for a year  it got crap  so I moved to another one (H&amp;M  you might have heard of it) then a year later  I went to TGI fridays  and I have been there for 2 years :) Part time though  while I was at college and stuff :)
8819,0,0.0,Q: what kind of films do you want to...direct?<br>A: Well I would LOVE to direct Horror films ideally. Just because they aren't so much about the writing  but more about the direction of the film. You need to think about so many more things  eg cinematography (lighting)  angles  editing. Everything is so much more creative than your standard Rom Com. Its more interesting and much more of a challenge to do it successfully :)
8820,0,0.0,Q: what kind of ice cream did you get? what kind is your favourite?... mine is mint chocolate chip... and it has to be the green kind (not the white)  otherwise its just not right :-)<br>A: I ended up with Vanilla  but I did do something with it  not just eat vanilla :) My favourite has got to be the mixed exotic kinds.

When I listen to songs  I don't really tend to listen to the words too much :P Its more the melody  sooooo  how about I just describe how I feel in the morning  and you can work out a song  yeah? :D Sooo  when I wake up. Usually I don't get enough sleep  so lets just say im not the best morning person there is lol. I like my sleep  and I do sort of  want to never get out of bed :P So  once im actually out of bed  I go into the kitchen and make a drink  pretty pronto.

Hmm  I liked parts of it  and other parts I didn't. I don't think it was written that well  well of course it was if it was just a novel about random people  but for the storyline of Skins  I think it was pretty out of character :( I like reading  but I get distracted pretty easily  so if Im enjoying it  I would continue to read  whereas if its hard to 'get into' then I probably wouldn't even finish it lol.
8841,0,0.0,Q: What was the last movie you saw in the theater? Was it good?<br>A: The Descent Part 2 I think. I haven't been there in a while. It wasn't that great  it was a bit like an extension of the first one and didn't seem to go anywhere :(

We suddenly had this MAD rush of people through the door  and it got really busy. Thing is  I was the only member of staff on  and my manager wasn't turning anyone away  so I was running the whole restaurant by myself. I think I was about to faint in my dream  because of the stress of everyone yelling at me for something to do  that I woke up lol. Then I fell back to sleep rather quickly and went back into it :'( Anywayyy...that doesn't count I take it :P  Well I argue with my family a lot  and I don't really get on with my father. So  we are ALWAYS arguing over things  and it really gets me down. We had a massive argument on tuesday night about something (he treats my sister differently  better  even though she is the one that causes all the trouble).

8917,0,0.0,Q: Which is your favourite movie of all time? and your favourite scene in it?<br>A: Hmmm  If you asked me this question a year ago  then I would have said &quot;The Descent&quot;  hands down! It was a horror film  but it had so many aspects of those traditional horror films  it wasn't just relying on blood and gore to bring the viewers in (obviously it had that too)  but it was more than the recent horror that is being made...So anyway  I loved it until the second one came out  and it just didn't flow as well as the first  and it didn't make the plot go anywhere. If anything  it went slightly backwards  only because it cleared up things from the first one  that would have been nice left to the imagination... :(

A bit of a crap question to ask you wasn't it really? :(
8937,0,0.0,Q: Who named you?<br>A: My dad did actually.  My mum named my sister  Charlotte so it was my dad's turn to name me. If they went with my mums choice  I would have been called 'Emily'. Quite funny considering I AM EMILY when it comes to Skins and relating to her character lol :P

8960,0,0.0,Q: Why do people more commonly skip breakfast than any other meal  considering that this is the time when the stomach is emptiest?<br>A: Well  I for one  never really feel that hungry when I wake up. I sleep at odd times (because of my insomnia) so when I get up  I normally wait until about 2ish and have a bit of toast which lasts me for breakfast and lunch. Here's my theory. When you get hungry  if you don't actually eat anything  after a while you start to go past it  and I for one  lose my appetite altogether. So here's my thinking. You are asleep overnight  thus losing your appetite whist you are asleep  then waking up having gone past it  and are no longer hunger? What do you think?

8966,0,0.0,Q: why do you love formspring? do you love formspring? do you love the anonymity of it?<br>A: Formspring  yeah I do love the anonymity of it. You can ask someone something  without actually asking them directly. So  it can save that awkward &quot;Why?&quot; moment that everyone dreads :P Formspring makes you question things  and I don't just mean that in the literal sense  it makes you question things about yourself  and as a result  you can find out things you didn't even know were there. Its informing :)

8970,0,0.0,Q: Why is &quot;Charlie&quot; short for &quot;Charles&quot; if they are both the same number of letters?<br>A: Because Charlie is also short for charlotte  and time for a story I think...  Once upon a time  there was a young girl called Charlotte. She was a pretty little girl  and everyone loved her. only one problem is  she had a great love for sports and all things male. She came out to her parents as being gay  and they wouldn't tolerate such a thing! So  they sent her to the nearby hospital and attached...pieces  and removed....bits.  She comes out  or is it still a she? His parents decided to cure the 'gay' issue  by changing her into a boy. Her former name  Charlotte had to be changed  and by rule of easiness  they changed it to Charles  so her former nickname would still be of use (they didn't want to change her name again  costing them more by deed poll). Charlie lived happily ever after  marrying the woman of his dreams... The end :)
8971,0,0.0,Q: Why is an alarm clock going &quot;off&quot; when it actually turns on?<br>A: Hmmm  I had SO many questions if &quot;turning on&quot; wasn't to do with Alarm Clocks. But I think you have me there...such a shame ;)
8972,0,0.0,Q: Why is an electrical outlet called an outlet when you plug things into it? Shouldn&#039;t it be called an inlet.<br>A: Because it pushes the power out? I feel you are trying to catch me out here missy :P
8973,0,0.0,Q: Why is Greenland called green when it is covered in ice? And Iceland is called ice when its got more green?...?????<br>A: I think someone was probably holding the map upside down when they named the places :(

8975,0,0.0,Q: Why is it called tourist season if we can&#039;t shoot at them?<br>A: I don't think I get this one either. Thats an epic fail...whats wrong with me today? :S
8976,0,0.0,Q: Why is it only drug dealers and software developers call their clients &#039;users&#039;?<br>A: I didn't know that drug dealers called their clients users? Or is that some joke that im not getting? lol Also ho's call their clients users ;)
8977,0,0.0,Q: Why is it so hard to let go? To go with the flow and not be in control of everything.<br>A: Because when you aren't in control  anything can happen  and thats rather scary. Things can look up  or things can go to shit. Having that sense of control  at least gives you a grip on the car while it is moving...
8978,0,0.0,Q: Why is it that people say they &quot;slept like a baby&quot; when babies wake up  like  every two hours?<br>A: Because babies actually sleep really well :) Its humans that are the problem. The babies are asleep  BUT because the parents are driven insane by constant 'baby-like' things  they hallucinate and THINK the baby is up. As a matter of fact  its still sleeping. I think its parents with the issues  never children...
8979,0,0.0,Q: Why is it that when things get wet they get darker  even though water is clear? :-)<br>A: Hmmm  good question. Never thought about that before. Perhaps because when we look at things through water  because of magnification  things appear closer and/or a different shape (eg a pencil appears bent). The magnification and density of the water  fragments the light thus giving it a different appearance or colour? I don't know  just a suggestion lol
8980,0,0.0,Q: Why is it that when you&#039;re driving and looking for and address you turn the radio down?<br>A: Concentration dude! You will understand when you eventually drive :P The music can be pretty distracting  so its a way of making sure you actually find the place :P I don't know if it helps mind you...
8981,0,0.0,Q: Why is my form so empty? =[<br>A: Your form? Why? :( You just dont have the friends that I have  and I think thats probably a good thing lol
8982,0,0.0,Q: Why is the 0 on a phone after 1 and not before 1?<br>A: Because its thinner  and they thought  &quot;if we start with the thinner numbers  we will know how much space we have to make the fatter ones&quot;. Thats why the 0 isn't like a O. Its more squashed  because they were losing space.
8983,0,0.0,Q: Why is u2018abbreviationu2019 such a long word? haha :-P<br>A: Its to emphasis the point of an abbreviation :P By using the word  it makes you want to do it... see ;) Its self publicity lol :P
8984,0,0.0,Q: why would i spy on you?... well the reasons are endless.. but if were to ba a good spy  i couldnt reveal why  now could i? haha sadly enough  you&#039;ll never know! ;-)<br>A: Its such a shame. I thought I was special  knowing you were just 'doing your job'  its heartbreaking ;)
8985,0,0.0,Q: wisdom or beauty?<br>A: Hmm  im going to be awkward and say both ;) because you can be beautiful and learn to be a wiser person  but there is no past being ugly lol.
8986,0,0.0,Q: Worst thing someone has ever done to you?<br>A: Ummm  its hard to pin point things. I don't really know if im honest. I get walked over A LOT by people  so I suppose just being taken advantage of.  Sometimes I do things for people (family  friends etc) and I don't really feel gratitude for it. So I suppose  putting in loads of effort to something  and it not being appreciated is a slap in the face :(
8987,0,0.0,Q: Would she ever doubt the way i feel about her in my heart? If tomorrow never comes  will she know how much I loved her ? Did I try in everyway  to show her every day? She&#039;s my only one.<br>A: Retro songageeeeeeeeee...
8988,0,0.0,Q: would you bring me flowers in the pouring rain? would you forever paint flowers for me   when i see you face would i know i&#039;ve made it home?<br>A: I have no clue where thats from  but I just googled it  and it came up with &quot;emo lyrics&quot;! HAHA! You got your answer ;)
8989,0,0.0,Q: Would you buy me dinner if I had no money and no food?<br>A: Of course. Sharing is good  sharing is nice  sharing solves all. Unless you are Cook/Freddie ;)
8990,0,0.0,Q: would you change your (last) name if you got married?  would you rather that your partner changed her (last) name? or keep things the same?<br>A: This is annoying it didn't appear :( How many others aren't appearing too :'( Anyway  to re-answer :) I think its quite sad when you change your name  only because I see it (kind of) as a way that you are giving up on your family and ditching them for a new one. BUT  I also see it as a wonderful way  when you gain someone elses name  because you are being accepted into your loved ones family  and thats awesome <3 So to solve all  I actually like double barreled names :) You don't give up your own  but you still gain your loved ones. Its like bringing both families together  rather than dropping or gaining  you get both :) How about you?
8991,0,0.0,Q: would you change your name if you got married? would you rather your partner changed their name? or keep everything the same?<br>A: I do like the idea of a double barreled name actually. Losing your name  is probably quite sad  but there again  changing your name is really really exciting  knowing you are part of the family of your loved one. So a combination of both  bringing both families together :) What do you think?
8992,0,0.0,Q: Would you dribble  if i touched your lip?<br>A: Only if I had recently been to the dentist.
8993,0,0.0,Q: would you ever come visit me?<br>A: I actually would yes :D I would love to in fact! There are a lot of issues with cost and time though. Would you ever visit me? :P
8994,0,0.0,Q: Would you ever date someone who was  I don&#039;t know 16?<br>A: Depends on the person  I can see where you are going with this ;)
8995,0,0.0,Q: would you ever do MDMA with a 16 year old?<br>A: LOL!!! Depends if the 16 year old was present IF I were to do MDMA :P
8996,0,0.0,Q: Would you ever eat 18 banana&#039;s in the space of 5days?<br>A: Ummm no. Talk about Potassium overload :S
8997,0,0.0,Q: Would you give your life to save someone else&#039;s?<br>A: It depends on the person. If it was my enemy who just murdered my best friend...im staying put lol. If it was someone who I loved with all my heart  I couldn't bare to see them be killed  so yes I would. Without hesitation  because if I lived  and they didn't  my life would have less meaning  knowing they should be here and not myself. Sorry to go on a downer there  I just watched Freddies ep  what do you expect :P
8998,0,0.0,Q: Would you have a u2018Happy Buttonu2019 installed on your body  connected to your brain  which would instantly make you very happy whenever you pressed it?<br>A: OH HELL YES!!! That would be AWESOME! Imagine how many people you could affect with your happiness? :D

9000,0,0.0,Q: would you like me to help you tidy up??? i love cleaning and organizing... and yep  i know im weird :-p<br>A: Thanks! Well  I just finished BUT its probably going to get messy again. So  you are welcome to pop around and wait until it gets messy again ;)
9001,0,0.0,Q: Would you like to know the day youu2019re going to die ahead of time? Why or why not?<br>A: I would yeah. Even though that would be TERRIFYING to know  but if there was no way I could prevent it from happening  then I would like to make sure I spend it with the people that I love. I couldn't bare dying when there are people who don't know how much I care about them. Its an important issue to me  which is why I always try to tell people  as much as possible how much I care. You never know when something could happen right? So its best to make sure you do the things that you really would need to before something happened :( Morbid! lol
9002,0,0.0,Q: Would you live in a different country? If yes  which one and why?<br>A: I would like to live in some parts of America yes. Only because its CHEAPER THAN HERE  the people seem more friendly than here  its hotter (in certain parts) and what can I sayyy? Everyone loves the USA :)
9003,0,0.0,Q: would you not do the devil then ? THATS OFFENSIVE!<br>A: The devil is hot. SMOKINNNN'!!!!
9004,0,0.0,Q: Would you prefer if good things happened  or interesting things?<br>A: Good things :) Because good things can be interesting things too  depending on how you look at them. BUT interesting things  can be bad things  and that sucks :( So good things :) Besides  they make you happy  and you can never have enough 'goodness' :D
9005,0,0.0,Q: Would you rather be good looking or rich?<br>A: Good Looking I think. Just because being rich can attract the wrong crowd all together! I wouldn't want to be popular because of my money and I know there are crowds that are drawn to that. I would rather be popular for being me  and being good looking certainly adds to that. There was something on the TV I watched once  and they said that better looking people are more likely to be employed for a job than uglier ones. This is because  when they see someone who is attractive in how they dress  hair etc  it shows they are self caring and someone who doesn't take much effort in their appearance  could show that they aren't willing to give much effort in that field of work. It was scientifically proven  but I think its bullshit really lol  or should be at least :)
9006,0,0.0,Q: Would you rather fall up or down the stairs? (yes it is possible to fall up the stairs)<br>A: Fall up the stairs  because at least you don't end up in a weird position on the floor :P You would end up lying on the stairs  feet first  so it protects your dignity if wearing a skirt ;) lol
9007,0,0.0,Q: Would you rather see a movie at the theater or at home on DVD? Why?<br>A: Hmmmm  it completely depends on the movie. Some things that come out and I REALLLLLLLLLLY want to see  then definitely cinema  just to get the whole interpretation right  eg sound  big screen  atmosphere etc. But  if its something that Im not too worried about  but I would still like to watch it. I would probably buy it on DVD and cuddle up in the comfort of my own home :) It does completely depend on the movie though  and the people I was to watch it with ;)
9008,0,0.0,Q: would you rather someone paint you a picture or write you a poem?<br>A: Hmmmm  it depends on how much effort they had to put into each of them. I mean  if someone was an artist and they painted me a picture  it wouldn't mean so much if say a writer painted me a picture. Or vice versa  if a writer wrote me a poem or an artist wrote me a poem  that one would mean more. Its all about which one took the most effort and concentration to do  you know what I mean? :D
9009,0,0.0,Q: Would you rather spend the rest of your life without a significant other  or would you rather have a partner who is extremely difficult?<br>A: Partner who is extremely difficult. Just because  living alone  its going to leave you depressed anyway  no one truly likes to live alone. So at least  someone who could be difficult  at least they would make you feel something. Even if one minute it was passion  the next anger  its better to feel something over nothing. I would choose the harder option  because no one deserves to be alone :)
9010,0,0.0,Q: Would you rather try skeleton or luge?<br>A: Can't I just be the person at the bottom who moves the foam about?
9011,0,0.0,Q: would you really come visit me? :-)<br>A: Of course I would! :) You're not far from New York right?

9018,0,0.0,Q: yea it is pretty gorgeous.. <33 anywhoo Are you a giver or a taker? do you prefer to give or receive? ;-)<br>A: Im a giver  definitely! I like to please other people  and when I see someone else's face light up at something I have done  its just the best feeling!!!! <33333 BUT  to receive is also an important part of the relationship. I think  personally its about finding a balance of both  but Im definitely a giver :)

I would want everyone to be around them and there for them  just incase they morn ;) I WOULD BE TERRIFIED! Umm  what I would do?

9067,0,0.0,Q: your Certificates-which takes 2 years to get  Masters-another 2 years  and PhD/Doctoral-another 2 years.. :-)people typically start college at age 18 and are done college by age 22 but then there is grad-school..so yea..loads of stuff  haha its so weird<br>A: HAHA! Yeah  we start college at 16  and then finish at 18  to go to university and usually come out about 21/22 with your degree depending on what you major in. Most degrees are 3 years  but if you wanted to be a Vet or a Doctor or a Surgeon etc  its about 6/7 years. Completely depends on the course :) The course im doing in september  basically gives me the equivilent of a degree  but in one year. Then I have the access to continue for another year  (making it a total of 2) to gain a masters in motion picture production  and the area I specialised in. So  Film School can definitely be a quicker route through education  but it is a lot more intense.
